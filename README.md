# UNCLE_McDONALD_NEEDS_YOUR_HELP
Computers have always been my passion. When I was a child, I always said "when I grow up, I want to be a computer scientist".
Now I am slowly trying to realize my dream.
I started to study computer science and write some simple programs from time to time. But I'm still a beginner and I realize that there are definitely more experienced people than me.
Programming for me is still just a hobby. But I hope that through your academy it will become something more. I will gain experience, start working as a professional and finally do what I like.
